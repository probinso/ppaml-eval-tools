# PPAML eval tools

The PPAML client tools are a set of libraries and scripts that allow [PPAML](http://ppaml.galois.com/)
TA2â€“4 teams to evaluate their own probabilistic programming systems in the same
way that we will at Galois.

`peval` is the Program Evaluator tool used in evaluation and system use profiles
of submitted Artifacts. Submited Artifacts are required to have two parts, an
"engine" that designates the required general resources for an artifact to run,
and a "solution" that performs some task using the resources in the engine.

### INSTALL

To install this program please use pip
  pip install --user .

Note that there are not yet version related restrictions found in the
required packages list.

### Teams
In order to keep track of who is providing artifacts, every team is assigned a
number, as listed below ::

| team.id | team.description |
| ------- |:----------------:|
| 1       |Integrator        |
| 3       |gamble            |
| 4       |BLOG              |
| 5       |{CH,D}imple       |
| 6       |Hakaru            |
| 7       |Venture           |
| 12      |Figaro            |

For now teams are static, and cannot be added by use of the peval tool.


### Challenge problems
Challenge problems also cannot be added through any `peval` command. They must be
added in `db_init.sql`. The database can then be updated with
`sqlite3 $PATH_TO_index.db < ./peval/db_init.sql`, which will rerun the
initialization commands. Due to uniqueness constraints, this should be idempotent.


### Registering with `peval`
The command ::
  $ peval register engine <team-id> <engine-directory>

will register the engine to a team, and print out a unique identifying hash
that we will call ENG-HASH

  $ peval register solution ENGHASH <problem-id> <solution-directory> \
                   <config-path> [config-path ...]

will register the solution to it's engine, and designate what problem number
is associated with the solution.
