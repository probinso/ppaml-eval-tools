			  PPAML client tools

The PPAML client tools are a set of libraries and scripts that allow PPAML [*]
TA2â€“4 teams to evaluate their own probabilistic programming systems in the same
way that we will at Galois.

We are presently without documentation. To better understand the program's
input parameters you may query it with ./peval -h
